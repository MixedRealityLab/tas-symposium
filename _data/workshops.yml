- title: Responsible Internet Futures
  description: >
    The Internet is of significant interest to research communities across academic disciplines and across the globe. Areas of current focus include digital divides, online privacy, online wellbeing, governance, censorship, and information propagation. It is essential our communities come together to consider how it might be possible to foster responsible Internet futures. This involves identifying the opportunities and challenges regarding a safe, equitable, accessible and useful Internet. It also requires taking a global perspective.

    In this half-day workshop we bring together interested researchers to suggest and debate visions for responsible Internet futures. We will combine invited speaker presentations with discussion sessions and we seek to co-create an initial pathway towards responsibility as part of these discussions. All TAS’24 Symposium attendees are welcome to join the workshop.


    The workshop is being run as within the UKRI-funded Responsible AI UK project ‘TAS-Hub and Good Systems Strategic Collaboration’. Two further online workshops on Responsible Internet Futures are planned within the project for 2025. If interested, attendees at the TAS’24 workshop will be invited to attend these subsequent ones too.

- title: "Automating Telepresence and Computer-mediated Communication: Identifying Implications and Challenges"
  description: >
    The implementation of autonomous features in computer-mediated communication and telepresence technologies (from videoconferencing to VR and robotic telepresence) is a growing trend. Whilst automation in such technologies can offer many benefits -e.g., faster communication and reduced mental workload -, it can also reduce the users' agency over how they present themselves in social contexts. In this workshop, we will be identifying and discussing the ethical considerations, as well as implications relating to usability and accessibility, that automation introduces when used in systems for remote communication. This will be a half-day, hybrid workshop consisting of brainstorming and guided discussion activities, aiming to initiate a conversation regarding the multifaceted implications of automation in this field and set directions for future work.
