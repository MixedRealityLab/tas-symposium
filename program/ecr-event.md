Join us for the Early Career Researcher Event at the TAS Symposium, a special gathering designed to connect, inspire, and support PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and early career academics in trustworthy autonomous systems.  The event will include invited speakers and discussion activities. Participants will have opportunities to network, socialise, gain mentorship insights and share their experiences in a more relaxed and informal setting.   

## When?

The event takes place in the afternoon and evening before the main conference 2pm on the 15th September 2024. 

## Where? 

The event will take place at the [Julius Glickman Conference Center]({{ "/attend/venue-information/" | relative_url }}) (same venue as the workshops the following day).
