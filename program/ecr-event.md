Ahead of the main programme, on 14th September 2024,  we will be running an optional half day event for Early Career Researchers (ECR). This will be open to all PhD students and those who identify as ECRs who are attending the Symposium. It will provide an opportunity for relaxed engagement and networking. Please indicate that you wish to attend this session when you register. All are welcome, but we have a limited space in the room so sign up will be necessary. This event is an no additional cost to registration and will take place in the Julius Glickman conference Center.
