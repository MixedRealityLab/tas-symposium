<p>This track invites submission of non-archival posters in the form of titles and short abstracts (up to 200 words). Submissions can include preliminary results, short prequels to or follow-ups of larger studies, provocative positions, early student research, as well as any recent research which is deemed interesting to the TAS community. Posters will be displayed alongside archival track posters, but they will not be archived in the proceedings. Selection will be made only based on the relevance of the topic to the TAS community and the space available in the venue.</p>

<p>Please <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/wXJA1TA5et">submit your title and abstract using this online form</a> by 16/06/2023 (23:59 BST).</p>

<p>Decisions will be returned by 23/06/2023, one week before the closure of registrations on 30/06/2023.</p>
