Heriot-Watt University’s Edinburgh campus is located on the western edge of the City of Edinburgh. For more information about how to get to Heriot-Watt, [please click here](https://symposium.tas.ac.uk/attend/travel-information/ "Information about travelling to Heriot-Watt University").  

The Transport for Edinburgh app will help you decide where to stay and when to travel. It is free and [can be downloaded here](https://tfeapp.com/ "Download the Transport for Edinburgh app") (available on iOS and Android).  

## Campus Hotel 
**Unfortunately, the campus hotel is now fully booked.**

<!--There is a hotel on campus, Courtyard by Marriot. It is located a short 5mins walk from the conference venue.

## Edinburgh Accommodation 
The campus is situated on the city's western edge, so accommodation along the 25 Bus route would make for easier travel arrangements (see map).
