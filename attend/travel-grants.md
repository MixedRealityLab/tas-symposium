The TAS Hub will offer a limited number of travel grants to support early career researchers attending the TAS Symposium. These grants are intended for postgraduate students, research assistants and postdocs not currently supported by the TAS programme (Hub or Nodes) to help meet the cost of travel, accommodation, and other expenses arising from attending the conference.

Further information will be released in the coming weeks, including details for how to apply. Tentatively, we anticipate the deadline for submitting travel grant applications will be in mid-May.
