The TAS Hub is pleased to offer a limited number of travel grants to support early career researchers attending the TAS Symposium.

## Who can apply?

These grants are intended for _postgraduate students, research assistants and postdocs_ not **currently supported by the TAS programme (Hub, Nodes or Responsibility Projects)** and with no other sources of funding to help meet the cost of travel, accommodation, and other expenses arising from attending the conference.

Applicants presenting papers and/or posters will be prioritised for support via these Travel Grants.

We aim to support as many applicants as possible within the available - limited - budget. As such, we will issue Travel Grants **up to a maximum of Â£350**.

To help us provide awards to those most in need, and to benefit as many ECR delegates as possible, we ask that you only apply for funding where no other support is available and carefully consider options to minimise the cost of your attendance. 

Where possible, we also encourage applicants to actively apply for other sources of travel funding to supplement Travel Grants awarded by the TAS Hub and reduce the scale of support they request here accordingly.

## How do I apply?

<!--Please submit your application form for a Travel Grant [here](https://forms.office.com/e/rZxwu1LKwU "Apply for a TAS '23 Travel Grant").-->
Applications for travel grants have now closed.

**The deadline to submit is <u>24th May 2023</u>.**

We will notify applicants by 31st May, allowing time to register for the Symposium before the Early Bird Registration deadline (7th June). Details of how to submit claims will be communicated directly to successful applicants.

If you require a letter to confirm your attendance at the Symposium in support of a visa application, please get in touch with the Organising Committee via [opsteam@tas.ac.uk](mailto:opsteam@tas.ac.uk "Email the TAS Operations team").
