<!--
  <p>
    We invite submissions on research focused on trustworthy autonomous systems (TAS), responsible and ethical
    artificial intelligence, and human-machine interaction.
  </p>
-->
  <p>
    Autonomous systems involve software applications and machines that can take actions with little or no human supervision. We are particularly interested in socio-technical systems involving both humans and machines working together, and automated decision-making processes and the ways in which they are employed by and impacting people. Trustworthy autonomous systems (TAS) generate positive outcomes and mitigate potentially harmful outcomes for people, societies, economies, and the environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Second International Symposium on Trustworthy Autonomous Systems will showcase 25 accepted papers as talks, which will include research focused on a broad range of topics related to the use of autonomous systems in a range of settings including: transport; health; sustainability; robotics; policing, defence, and surveillance. There will also be talks and 13 extended abstracts presented as posters on broad concepts surrounding the use of AS such as: novel research methods; understanding attitudes towards AS; generative AI and AI prompting; regulation and responsibility. All of these will be published in the ACM Digital Library. We will also have some exciting keynotes from leading experts in the field, listed <a href="https://symposium.tas.ac.uk/2024/program/keynotes/" title="TAS '24 keynotes">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The event will include a welcome session with networking happy hour, poster sessions, paper presentations, expert keynotes, and a conference banquet, as well as a day of interactive workshops prior to the main conference. Presentations will feature cutting-edge research on trustworthy autonomous systems, responsible and ethical artificial intelligence, and human-machine interaction, with panels and workshops exploring socio-technical systems, automated decision-making, and their real-world impacts. There will also be networking opportunities with leading experts, researchers, and professionals in the field, including networking with PhD students and post-doctoral researchers in an early-career event before the conference.
  </p>

  <p>We still have one open submission track to get your work to the symposium:<br>
    <ul><li>A <a href="https://symposium.tas.ac.uk/2024/submit/nonarchival-posters/">non-archival posters track</a>, particularly suitable for researchers more used to non-archival conferences (poster proposals due September 2).</li></ul></p>

 <!-- <p>
    We invite full-paper submissions, poster abstracts, and workshop proposals on research that addresses the challenges
    of designing, building, and deploying Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS). Contributions may consider technical,
    social, legal, and ethical issues and their impacts on individuals, society, and the economy. Submissions may come
    from disciplines including, but not limited to, engineering, computer science, psychology, social sciences, law, and
    arts & humanities. There will also be an event before the conference for Doctoral students and Early Career Researchers in these areas.
  </p>

  <p>
    Submissions will be selected for publication following peer review. Submission information for <a href="/2024/submit/papers-posters/">papers</a>, <a href="/2024/submit/papers-posters/">posters</a>, and <a href="/2024/submit/workshops/">workshops</a> has now closed.
    Proceedings, including full papers and abstracts, will be published in the ACM Digital Library.
  </p>


  <p>In addition to the papers and workshop tracks, we have 3 new tracks that are accepting submissions:</p>
 
<ol><li>
A <a href="/2024/submit/fast-track-papers/">fast track for papers</a> that will be published in the ACM Library conference proceedings (full drafts due July 25).
 </li><li>
A <a href="/2024/submit/showcase/">track for previously published papers</a> that we will showcase and discuss at the Symposium, but not publish in the conference proceedings (self-nominations for these also due July 25).  
 </li><li>
A <a href="/2024/submit/nonarchival-posters/">non-archival posters track</a>, particularly suitable for researchers more used to non-archival conferences (poster proposals due September 2).
