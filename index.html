  <h2 id="our-call-for-papers">Our call for papers</h2>

  <p>
    We invite submissions on research focused on trustworthy autonomous systems (TAS), responsible and ethical
    artificial intelligence, and human-machine interaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Autonomous systems involve software applications and machines that can take actions with little or no human
    supervision. We are particularly interested in socio-technical systems involving both humans and machines working
    together, and automated decision-making processes and the ways in which they are employed by and impacting people.
    Trustworthy autonomous systems (TAS) generate positive outcomes and mitigate potentially harmful outcomes for
    people, societies, economies, and the environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    We invite full-paper submissions, poster abstracts, and workshop proposals on research that addresses the challenges
    of designing, building, and deploying Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS). Contributions may consider technical,
    social, legal, and ethical issues and their impacts on individuals, society, and the economy. Submissions may come
    from disciplines including, but not limited to, engineering, computer science, psychology, social sciences, law, and
    arts & humanities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Submissions will be selected for publication following peer review. Submission information will be released soon.
    We plan to publish the proceedings, including full papers and abstracts, in the ACM Digital Library (approval pending).
